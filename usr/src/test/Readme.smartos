The procedure to run the Illumos tests under SmartOS differs from other
distributions because of the zone-centric nature of the distribution,
and because there is no built-in package management for the global zone.

See ./smartos-test/README which describes a wrapper script which configures
a SmartOS system for testing, and optionally executes selected test suites.
