Strictly speaking, this is not a set of tests. Rather, it is a wrapper that
automates most (but not all, in the case of zfs-test configuration!) of the
setup from $SRC/test/Readme.smartos.

Specifically, the script here will:

* setup loopback mounts for any files from the smartos "tests-[stamp].tgz"
  file that need to be installed to a normally read-only location
* configure pkgsrc
* install required test packages
* execute tests that should all pass

Over time, we will add to the set of tests that are executed.
