/*
 * This implements a fixed-size hash table that uses the 2Q algorithm
 * from Johnson and Shasha to manage the contents of the entries.
 *
 * Briefly, there are two fixed sizes lists (0 and 1).  New entries are
 * added to the head of list 1, and upon subsequent access (lookup), are
 * moved to the head of list 0.  Entries that fall off the end of list 0
 * are pushed onto the head of list 1, and entries that fall off the end
 * of list 1 are deleted.  The percentage of the total size of the cache
 * for each list is determined by the parameter 'a', which is a percentage
 * (0-100) of the cache size that is dedicated to list 0.
 *
 * This implementation does generalize this algorithm somewhat to an
 * arbitrary number of lists (instead of just 2) via the QQCACHE_NUM_LISTS
 * and QQCACHE_INSERT_LIST preprocessor symbols (defined in
 * sys/qqcache_impl.h).  New entries are added to list QQCACHE_INSERT_LIST
 * and as each list gets full, the oldest entry in each list is pushed to
 * the head of the succeeding list, and the oldest entries are removed
 * from the cache (so each list never has more entries than their maximum
 * size).
 *
 * The API itself is very similar to that of refhash.  A qqcache_link_t struct
 * is embedded within the definition of the entries that are being stored in
 * a given qqcache_t.  Functions are provided to hash/compare the tag (key)
 * value of an entry, as well as destroying the entry during the creation
 * of the cache.  Lookups then occur by passing a pointer to the key value
 * being looked up.
 *
 * NOTE: As one can take references to entries in the cache via the
 * qqcache_hold() function, refheld entries that are marked for deletion are
 * not counted when tracking the cache size, and their dtor function is not
 * called until the last reference has been released (by calling the
 * qqcache_rele() function).
